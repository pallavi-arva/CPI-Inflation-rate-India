This dataset on the All India Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a fantastic choice for an Excel project, Palli! It allows you to demonstrate your ability to handle economic data, perform complex aggregations, and create time-series visualizations.

Since you have already done the work on Pivot Tables and Data Cleaning (as seen in your files), here is a professional GitHub description tailored specifically to this Excel Dashboard project.

 India Consumer Price Index (CPI) Analysis Dashboard:
Macroeconomic Trends & Inflation Insights (2013 - 2023)
Project Overview:
This project involves a comprehensive analysis of the All India Consumer Price Index (CPI) dataset, spanning from January 2013 to April 2023. The goal was to transform raw economic indices into an interactive Excel Dashboard that tracks inflation trends across various sectors (Rural, Urban, and Combined) and commodity groups like Food, Energy, and Housing.

Data Engineering & Excel Workflow
Data Cleaning: * Addressed missing values (NA) in the Housing and Sector columns.

Standardized date formats and ensured consistency in commodity categories.

Pivot Table Architecture: * Created dynamic aggregations to calculate the Sum of CPI Inflation % by year.

Analyzed Fluctuation by Components (e.g., Cereals, Oils, and Fats) to identify price volatility.

Segmented data by Sector (Rural vs. Urban) to compare regional inflation impacts.

Advanced Formulas: Used VLOOKUP/INDEX-MATCH for category mapping and GETPIVOTDATA to feed the dashboard interface.

Dashboard Features & Visuals
Yearly Inflation Tracker: A line chart depicting the trajectory of the General Index over a 10-year period.

Sector Comparison: A grouped bar chart comparing Rural and Urban CPI indices to highlight cost-of-living differences.

Commodity Deep-Dive: A sunburst or treemap showing the weightage of different categories (Food, Apparel, Education, etc.) within the total index.

Interactive Slicers: Enabled filtering by Year, Month, and Sector for real-time data exploration.

Key Insights
Inflation Spikes: Identified specific years (e.g., 2020-2022) with higher volatility in the "Food and Beverages" and "Energy" sectors.

Rural vs. Urban: Data suggests that Rural sectors often face different price pressures in "Cereals and Products" compared to Urban centers.

Consistency: The "General Index" shows a steady upward trend, providing a clear view of the long-term purchasing power changes in the Indian economy.
